Hi Poornima

 

Thank you for the talk, I thought it went well and hope you do too. Let me know if you have any additional questions!

As discussed I am sending you a small task for you to prepare and return to me. I will setup a new meeting once I have received it. 

The task should be achievable within 1-2 hours, depending on the level of complexity (and once you have your environment up and running).

 

Please notice that this is only to have something to discuss during the interview. We will not draw any conclusions based on your solution.

The attached JSON file contains some mock data of our products and categories. Use the file and create a small project, what you create is optional. Feel free to use any backend technology such as Node.js, ASP.NET, PHP and etc. If you want to challenge yourself, use C#/.Net.

Hereâ€™s a few ideas that you can choose from:

1. create a web application with pages that show the products or categories. The pages could be a PLP (product listing page) or a PDP (product detail page). 
They can be very simple with minimum styling or no styling at all.
2. create a web application with an advanced search engine that shows products or categories with a flexible, better and stronger search experience.
3. create a REST API for the product and category endpoints which returns the data based on userâ€™s requests, parameters and etc.
 

Please send the link to the repository in GitHub, so we can review the project ðŸ˜Š
