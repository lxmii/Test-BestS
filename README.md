# Test-BestS
This repo contains the finished result of my test from Bestseller

This is an excellent project for beginners to learn the basics of backend development with C#.
The original assigner informed me that for an experience developer, the project is doable in 1-2 hours.
In my experience, as a complete beginner it took me 5 days to understand, learn C# and implement advanced object oriented concepts to tackle the project.

The project is to create a webapp that reads the json file test-technical-prep.json and creates RestAPI's that displays data based on user inputs.

I employed dependency injection, inheritence in the project. I used newtonsoft to serialise the json file.
As to the architecture, I created Models and Controller namespaces.I have also included business layer that implements the WEB API's, and a data extraction layer to read the json data 
in the form of a class object.

Result:
The project successfully creates a web application that employs RestAPI accepting user inputs for the following and returns data in json format.
1. Product ID
2. Category and 
3. Size 

This list can be easily extended without disturbing the over all structure of the business logic, thanks to object oriented functionality of C# and the architecture employed
